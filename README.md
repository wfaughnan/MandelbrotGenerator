# MandelbrotGenerator
These python scripts allow for easy generation of high-quality fractal images. You can choose to generate the Mandelbrot Set, Burning Ship, or Julia Sets using these two python scripts. These scripts rely on Pillow and Numpy, so those packages must be installed before you use this code on your machine.
